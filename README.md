 responsive-portfolio project

create a 3-page website that will act as a portfolio for me when applying to jobs.

The About me page will tell about who I am through the use of:
  1. What I write about myself in the About Me section
  2. The way I designed the webpage
  3. With the links to my LinkedIn Profile; which will allow the viewer to access more information about myself.
  
      If I have effectively achieved this goal, please note the following:
        1. I am new to web development, but I am excited and eager to learn.
        2. I like a very sleek and minimalist webpage
        3. I am on social media platforms, to help network in my field.
  
  The portfolio page will act as a template for now but will later:
  1. Will allow me to quickly and easily attach my projects as I make them throughout the class.
  2. I will showcase my talents, abilities, and strengths to a potential employer.
  
  The contact page will simply allow the user a way to contact me by allowing them to submit their email and a message.
